### Lodge Complaint
Victims who have fallen into the traps of fraudsters will be able to lodge a complaint to the admin from here. Their identity will be revealed only to the admin for official purposes.

The victim after lodging the complaint will be able to see the complaint status, i.e., how far the complaint has been processed and whether he/she has received full justice or not. 
In order to verify whether the complaint lodged by the victim is a authentic or not, the victim has to upload the necessary supporting documents.
